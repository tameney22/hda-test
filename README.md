# HUON D'AUVERGNE DIGITAL ARCHIVE

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview of the Project
Version 3.0 of the Huon Digital Archive includes a thorough overhaul to the ReactJS framework in order to support the dynamics requirements of a scholary collaborative element in which users will be able to leave annotation postings and administators will be able to approve/disprove those annotations through their own respective portal. The Huon Digital Archive is a project that is meant to portray the scholarly translations of this Franco-Italian poem that has been translated by a group of professors who have now moved their work to a virtual platform. We were involved specifically in the version 3.0 changes that were mentioned above. 
## Implemented Features
The already implemented features consist of the entirety of the website prior to our involvement. This has taken up a majority of our time as we had to overhaul the website in its entirety over to ReactJS whilst deciphering their code base and fixing errors whilst coming across them. 
## Not Yet Implemented Features
The not yet implemented features consist of the collaborative element that will host the slew of functionality that will enable users to annotate and make postings alongside their annotations. This is in the works and you will see code that has begun to integrate this functionality within the system. In it is currently in its developement phase and is not complete. The other unimplemented feature is the administration portal as that was pushed off as we had to get the entire website over to React. This portal will be added in the coming week(s).
## Dependencies
In terms of dependencies we have made this incredibly easy for users and those who are intrigued by the functionality of our code. We recommend you use Visual Studio Code, Git, Node, and NPM. NPM makes this very easy because all dependencies will be automatically kept up to date and tied in for full support of the website's functionality. 
## Instructions for Compilation
Please see the available scripts below. npm start -> will build and compile the entirety of the website within your localhost. 
## Instructions for Running
Please refer to the above section, and look at the available scripts portion below. In order to run our software all that is needed is to run the instructions for compilation and then to enjoy the website, there are no active inputs needed to keep running our website. Feel free to interact with all of our functionality. 

## Additional Info
This repository was created to better group our files in sight of the interim code assignment, commit history is not accurate to the actual development of the software shown. You were added to the hda-test repository as well if you would like to see the actual "working" repository. However the same contents will be shown. 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
