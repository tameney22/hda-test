A paper codex measuring 27 cm by 20 cm,manuscript T survives today despite a tortuous history. In 1904, a fire ravaged the Biblioteca Nazionale, destroying or badly damaging many of the library’s holdings. The Turin Huon d’Auvergne survived,even if the text and illuminations that extended into the outermargins of the manuscript are missing or damaged beyond repair. Fortunately, the nineteenth-century philologist Pio Rajna made a personal transcription of the text of manuscript T, and a notebook of this transcription, alongside another of manuscript 32 of the Biblioteca del Seminario Vescovile (manuscript P), are conserved at the Biblioteca Marucelliana of Florence.",
